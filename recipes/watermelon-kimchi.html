    <h3>Put the whole food to use with this recipe</h3>
        <p>I must admit, I first got the idea to make this from a Tik Tok. As I write this, I've got a watermelon sitting on my counter, waiting to be turned into delcious kimchi. This is a rather accessible recipe that calls for a limited number of ingredients that most people will be able to find at their local grocery. </p>
    <h3>Why watermelon of all things?</h3>
        <p>I grew up eating plenty of watermelon in the muggy midwestern summers. Alas, those memories are tarnished by the myriad of watermelon rinds that we never seemed to have a use for. Watermelon rind is edible once processed and provides plenty of nutrients and a satisfying crunch similar to cabbage, so... why not try it?</p>
    <h3>Kimchi Process</h3>
        <p>Thankfully, this is not as labor intensive as making traditional kimchi!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs watermelon rind slices-peeled</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp coarse sea salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Kimchi Seasoning</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cloves of garlic-minced</li>
            <li>5 Tbsp gochugaru/coarse red chili flakes</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp honey</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Garnish</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>chopped green onions</li>
            <li>sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Optional extras</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>&frac13; cup of watermelon juice-blended</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Preperation</h3>
