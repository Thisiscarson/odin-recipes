    <h3>A fun take on a fall classic</h3>
        <p>Growing up in the midwest, I grew to love corn, but just eating grilled/roasted corn gets old after a while. </p>
    <h3>Why make corn into a rib?</h3>
        <p>Turning corn into a rib takes a midwest staple and turns it into a flexible, fun, and flavor filled item that can be done on a grill or in the oven with relativ ease.</p>
    <h3>Make those ribs!</h3>
        <p>Thankfully, this doesn't add much more work to making your average ear of corn. All we'll do is cut the corn in strips off of the "ear" and move on from there.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ear(s) of corn</li>
            <li>A generous amount of the seasoning blend of your choice- It'll take a bunch to coat those ribs the way they deserve. </li>
            <li> Neutral oil of your choice- to give the seasoning something to stick to.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Preperation</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Slice the ears of corn, top to bottom, after standing them up at a 90-degree angle. Be careful with your knife. Seperate the kernals in sheets from the core of the ear. </li>
           <li>Douse the lengths of corn with a healthy glug of your oil.</li>
            <li>Add your seasoning(s) and corn ribs to a bowl and toss to coat</li>
            <li>Toss your corn ribs on a preheated grill (medium high or hotter). Grill for 6-8 minutes, until black spots form and the corn starts to curl.</li>
            <li>Flip the ribs and cook for one minute.</li>
            <li>Toss with a bit of extra seasoning if you'd like and chow down!</li>
        </ol>
