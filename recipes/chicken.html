    <h3>Where I started</h3>
        <p>While I love cooking now, it wasn't always this way. I used to dread cooking, mostly because I didn't understand what I was doing
            or have a clear idea of the sorts of flavors that I enjoy.
        </p>
    <h3>Look at it! It's Rawwww!!!</h3>
        <p>Oddly enough, I grew up watching Hell's Kitchen with my parents. I'd watch Gordon Ramsay swear up a storm while telling a contestant what a poor job they did cooking something. Over time, this led me to have a fear of undercooking food for a while.  </p>
    <h3>Cook it through</h3>
        <p>While I've moved past the fear of undercooking food, I figured it'd be fun to reflect on how I used to cook chicken as a child. Strap in this gets complex...</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken breasts</li>
            <li>A pot of boiling water. </li>
            <li>Some salt (not too much because I was afraid of having too much sodium) and granulated garlic for fLaVoR</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Preperation</h3>
